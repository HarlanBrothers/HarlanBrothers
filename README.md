- 👋 Hi, I’m @HarlanBrothers
- 👀 I am a data scientist, mathematician, musician, and inventor. I've published journal articles related to number theory and the fractal geometry of music and hold six U.S. patents. For six years I had the great good fortune to work with Benoit Mandelbrot and Michael Frame at the Yale Fractal Geometry Workshops. I also authored the chapter entitled, "The Nature of Fractal Music" in the memorial volume Benoit Mandelbrot: A Life in Many Dimensions (https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/8238).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Russian.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on number theory, fractals, and music.
- 📫 How to reach me: harlan.j.brothers@gmail.com
